# HRIS ATS (Human Resource Information System - Applicant Tracking System)

### About

HRIS ATS is a project aimed at automating the testing process for a Human Resource Information System's Applicant Tracking System (ATS). Leveraging the power of Jest, a popular automation tool, we can efficiently automate the testing of our ATS application's APIs and ensure its functionality and reliability.

### Automation API Testing using Jest

Automation plays a vital role in maintaining the quality and effectiveness of software systems. By utilizing Jest, we can streamline and enhance our testing efforts by automating the execution of API tests within the HRIS ATS application. Jest enables us to make API calls, validate responses, and assess the integration and functionality of our ATS system.
